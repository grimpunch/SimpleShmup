# Goodbye Earthlings!
### formally known as SimpleShmup 

Goodbye Earthlings! is my attempt at making a SHMUP (Shoot-em-up) style game for PC , using Unity Engine 5,
while following common genre conventions of popular games in the genre such as Dodonpachi or Touhou.

  - Vertical Scrolling
  - Simple, clean sprite based art (Not final art)
  - Limited inputs for simplistic design (Directions, Focus, Fire, and Capture laser.
  - A collectible based special weapon where you charge a enemy capturing tractor beam aimed by laser.

### Version
0.0.8

### Changelog:
  - Multiplayer stubs put in. works with multikeyboard or whatever you can map in the unity launcher, or multiple xbox game pads.
  - Controls for gamepads in single player too, where you can use the stick or the dpad , and A,B,X to shoot, capture and focus.
  - Laser Charge based on collectibles now. working on making them generate on kill and head to the players based on distance and move towards the players.
  - Main Menu implemented and basic setting menu.
