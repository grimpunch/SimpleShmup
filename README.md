# SimpleShmup 
(very bad working title)

SimpleShmup is my attempt to get started making a Shmup (Shoot-em-up) style game for PC , using Unity Engine 5,
while following common genre conventions of popular games in the genre such as Dodonpachi or Touhou.

  - Vertical Scrolling
  - Simple, clean sprite based art (Not final art)
  - Limited inputs for simplistic design (Directions[WASD/Arrows], Focus[X/Left Shift], and Fire [Z/Left Ctrl])

### Version
0.0.5


### Screenshot

### Installation

Clone the repo, and open the project in Unity 5.0.1f1.
Main scene for development so far is "Level1.unity"
Enable and disable components and prefabs in the scene for testing , currently everything isn't placed in the scene, just the latest entity being tweaked, design will start in the level when all types are finalised for Level1 at least.

### Development

I'm developing this on my own, but if you understand my setup and feel like contributing, i'll gladly discuss with you the current plans and respect input from advice, pull requests, assets, and more.

### Todos

 - Design more bullet types and create pools for them.
 - Add more code comments.
 - Specify Level walkthroughs and finalise design to lock in spec.
 - Create more issues to illustrate the project direction for readers.
