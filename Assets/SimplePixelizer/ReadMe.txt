Thank you for downloading SimplePixelizer!

What it does:
SimplePixelizer downgrades a rendered image.

Instructions:
Like any other image effect, just add it as a component to a camera.

You can set the amount of times it downgrades with the 'pixelize' variable or you can enable 'Fixed Resolution' and set a fixed width and height.
You can also enable color blending. This will downgrade the rendered image exactly the way it is, without changing the filter mode.
